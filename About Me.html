          <h3>High School Graduation</h3>
          <p>
            Completed my high school education with a focus on Mathematics and
            technology and Started Study In ASPU ITE College.

          <h3>The second academic year</h3>
          <p>
            After the materials that generally discuss mathematics and physics,
            I started studying introductory materials on programming and
            algorithms, media systems, and programming languages such as Python
            and C++.

          <h3>The third academic year</h3>
          <p>
            The academic year started with studying algorithms and data
            structures, which are considered the foundation of this field that I
            am studying. Honestly, it was a difficult subject to study. I also
            started studying OOP in Java, which serves as a preparation for
            algorithms and data structures. Of course, there were also courses
            on computer organization, computer architecture, and assembly
            language.

          <h3>The fourth academic year</h3>
          <p>
            I did not succeed this year in passing the algorithms and data
            structures course, but the internet technologies and web programming
            course caught my attention and received most of my focus during this
            semester, which enabled me to complete three programming languages
            in a short period of time, and this is something great.
